            <p>Project: Save Us is a community-sourced, not-for-profit search engine dedicaded to reducing the carbon footprint
                of the food industry. Using our search engine, you can find the most environmentally friendly product choices
                for any food you might want and find information on locations, pricing, brands, and relative carbon impact of your
                selections
            </p>
            <h3>Our Mission:</h3>   
            <p>
                By implementing this system, people will be given the opportunity to become more 
                aware of their import-based carbon footprint and can do things to shrink it and prevent its growth. In addition, 
                the database’s information on where more locally-sourced and less carbon-impactful products can be found in users’ 
                areas will help grow and sustain local communities and economies.
