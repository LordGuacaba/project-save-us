            <h3>Our Mission:</h3>   
            <p>
                By implementing this system, people will be given the opportunity to become more 
                aware of their import-based carbon footprint and can do things to shrink it and prevent its growth. In addition, 
                the database&#x27s information on where more locally-sourced and less carbon-impactful products can be found in users&#x27
                areas will help grow and sustain local communities and economies.
